Abstract
Background
The aim of this study is to investigate the relationships between HbA1c and other risk factors like obesity functional fitness lipid profile and inflammatory status in older adults Epidemiological evidence suggests that HbA1c is associated with cardiovascular and ischemic heart disease risk Excess of body weight and obesity are considered to play a central role in the development of these conditions Age is associated with several risk factors as increased body fat and abdominal fat deterioration of the lipid profile diabetes raising in inflammatory activity or decreased functional fitness
Methods
Data were available from participants aged 65-95 years including women and men Anthropometric variables were taken as was functional fitness blood pressure and heart rate Blood samples were collected after h fasting and HbA1c hs-CRP TG TC HDL-C LDL-C and glycaemia were calculated Bivariate and partial correlations were performed to explore associations amongst the variables of interest Differences between groups were explored by performing factorial analysis of variance
Results
HbA1c levels ranged from 4.6%-9.4 with of the cases below Women had higher HbA1c glycaemia TC BMI and lower and upper flexibility than men Men had higher BW WC 6-min walking distance and VO2peak than women Age SBP DBP HRrest HRpeak HDL-C LDL-C TG TG/HDL-C ratio Log10 hs-CRP upper and lower strength and agility and dynamic balance were similar in men and women HbA1c had positive associations with glycaemia HDL-C TG/HDL-C BW WC BMI but not with functional fitness TC LDL-C Log10 hs-CRP PAD or PAS Obese participants had higher HbA1c than non-obese only when IDF and not USDHHS criteria were applied
Conclusions
Older women had higher HbA1c than men even after controlling for BMI HbA1c associates equally with BW BMI or WC Population-based criteria are recommended to classify obesity and to identify higher levels of HbA1c in obese older adults HbA1c associates with atherogenic dyslipidemia particularly with TG and TG/HDL-C ratio but not with TC HDL-C or LDL-C HbA1c is not associated with hs-CRP and with functional fitness and aerobic endurance
